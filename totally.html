	<p>Totallypromotional is in the transition of consolidating all old websites to one website which contains all the product lines. I am one of the three developers working on this project. I have independently accomplished several projects since I started in Totallypromotional, which are developing totallytotebags.com home page and category pages, developing an artwork testing tool for graphic designers to test the coordinates of the customizable templates, developing cart pages and order email templates for several websites owned by Totallypromotional. Besides these, I am also responsible for maintaining the websites, conducting cross-browser testing, etc.</p>
