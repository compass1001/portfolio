        <p>I am currently an intern at <a href="http://www.mplp.org/" target="_blank">Michigan Poverty Law Program (MPLP)</a>. MPLP is a cooperative effort of Legal Services of South Central Michigan and the University of Michigan Law School. MPLP provides state support services to local legal aid programs and other poverty law advocates.</p>
         <p>I have five main responsibilities there: graphic design, web development, web content development, testing, and Drupal Modules updating and testing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <li><h3>Graphic Design</h3></li>
            <p>One of my tasks in MPLP is graphic design, including logos, images for different social media, websites and so forth. The images below are some of my work examples.</p>
            <img src="images/projects/logo_mplp.jpg" />
            <img src="images/projects/mplp_1.jpg" />
            <img src="images/projects/mplp_2.jpg" />
            <img src="images/projects/mplp_3.jpg" />
            <img src="images/projects/mplp_4.jpg" />
            <li><h3>Web Development</h3></li>
            Another daily task of mine is web development. I am responsible for modifying the code of Michigan Legal Help website to make it user-friendly on different devices(responsive design). In addition, my recent task is to implement <a href="http://briefbankdev.mplp.org/"> the brief bank website</a> I have designed using Drupal.
         	<li><h3>Updating the Web Content</h3></li>
            <p>MPLP has launched a companion site <a href="http://michiganlegalhelp.org/" target="_blank">MichiganLegalHelp.org</a>, providing legal information and resources for Michigan residents who are representing themselves in civil legal matters. Since the site is newly lauched, we need to migrate the content from the old site to it and tailor the content to match the need of the new system. What I am doing is uploading different content types to the system, including Articles, Checklist, FAQ, ect., and running quality assurance protocols to ensure that all information on the website is accurate.</p>
            <li><h3>Testing the automated online interviews</h3></li>
            <p>LawHelp Interactive uses automated online interviews to help residents who represent themselves to prepare documents they need to file a case. I am responsible for testing these interviews to make sure they work as the way they should do.</p>
            <li><h3>Updating and Testing the Drupal Modules for different sites</h3></li>
            I am responsible for updating and testing the drupal modules of two sites administrated by MPLP: <a href="http://www.michiganimmigrant.org/">mirc.mplp.org</a> and<a href="http://michiganlegalhelp.org/"> michiganlegalhelp.org.</a>
